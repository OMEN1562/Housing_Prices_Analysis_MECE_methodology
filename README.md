***MECE: Mutually Exclusive Coleectively Exhaustive***


MECE is a principle used by management consulting firms to describe a way of organizing information. The MECE principle suggests that to understand and fix any large problem, you need to understand your options by sorting them into categories that are: Mutually Exclusive– Items can only fit into one category at a time and Collectively Exhaustive – All items can fit into one of the categories.

MECE is a systematic problem-solving framework that helps to solve complex problems. It can help you eliminate confusion and focus on key data that points the way toward success.

In case interviews, the MECE principle is a valuable tool for creating management consulting firms that break down complicated problems into basic components you can evaluate and help you get to the root of the problem. Thinking this way is useful because it helps you avoid duplication and clarifies your options for resolving the problem.

To put it in “plain English,” a MECE set is one that has no overlaps and no gaps. You might also see it called completely exhaustive rather than collectively.
